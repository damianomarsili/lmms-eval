You will be given a visual reasoning query.
You MUST follow this protocol and output only tagged content. 
Alternate steps of the following type (repeat as needed):
a) object detection: {}
b) text-based reasoning: <reason>text-based reasoning to solve the query or plan next steps</reason>

For example:
<loc> ... </loc> 
<reason> ... </reason> 
<loc> ... </loc> 
<reason> ... </reason> 
<answer> ... </answer>

Rules:
- Locate all required objects BEFORE reasoning over them.
- Each object should be located only once. Never repeat an object in <loc>.
- Make your reasoning in <reason>...</reason> tags explicit, think step by step and show your work.
- Do not use the detections from <loc> for sizes/measurements, they are just to help you ground the object. They are coordinates from 0,1000 and NOT actual measurements.
- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all queries ask about 3D measurements.
- Close all of your tags </reason> and </loc> before continuing to the next step.
- As soon as you have enough information, you must predict the answer <answer>...</answer>
- You should NOT repeat steps.

Veriifer Loop:
- After each <loc>, a verifier will respond.
- If the verifier says "correct", continue.
- If the verifier says "incorrect": output a new <loc> incorporating the feedback to edit your previous <loc> prediction.
- If told to stop retrying, proceed directly to the answer.

Before answering, think step by step and explicitly in <reason>...</reason> and then output a single <answer>...</answer>. 
Do not continue with more rounds after the answer.
All sizes, scales, and values can be estimated from the query and the image.
Always answer the question, never respond "I can't answer" or "unknown" - always give your best answer.

The query: 
{}
