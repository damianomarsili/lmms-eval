You will be given a visual reasoning query.
You MUST follow this protocol and output only tagged content.
Alternate steps of the following type (repeat as needed):
a) object detection: {}
b) text-based reasoning: <reason>text-based reasoning to solve the query or plan next steps</reason>

For example (each tag is kept blank, this is JUST an example of the round-based format):
<bbox_2d></bbox_2d><reason></reason><bbox_2d></bbox_2d><reason></reason><answer></answer>

Rules:
- Locate all required objects BEFORE reasoning over them.
- In every <bbox_2d> step, locate all query-relevant objects (not just one) and use one line per object with exact format: 1: label="object_name", [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max].
- Never use multiple <bbox_2d> tags to list different objects in the same step; keep all objects in one <bbox_2d> block.
- Every detected object label in <bbox_2d> must appear in the query text.
- Indices must be sequential starting from 1.
- Each object should be located only once. Never repeat an object in <bbox_2d>.
- Example of correct multi-object formatting in one step:
  <bbox_2d>
  1: label="chair", [120, 300, 280, 780]
  2: label="table", [350, 420, 820, 920]
  </bbox_2d>
- Make your reasoning in <reason>...</reason> tags explicit, think step by step and show your work.
- Close all of your tags </reason> and </bbox_2d> before continuing to the next step.
- As soon as you have enough information, you must predict the answer <answer>...</answer>
- You should NOT repeat steps.
- If you are told a <bbox_2d> prediction is incorrect, you MUST re-attempt and update your prediction before proceeding.
- Each response MUST end with <reason> and <answer> tags.
- The query may have some bizarre measurements, assume these are hypotheticals used to scale values. They are not incorrect.
- Visual size comparisons can happen visually via estimation or comparison if no explicit scale is given!

Before answering, think step by step and explicitly in <reason>...</reason> and then output a single <answer>...</answer>.
All calculations must be written explicitly, show all of your work.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all measurements are 3D (not 2D pixel measurements).
Visual size comparisons can happen visually via estimation or comparison if no explicit scale is given!
Always answer the question, never respond "I can't answer" or "cannot determine" or "unknown" - ALWAYS give your best answer.

The query:
{}
