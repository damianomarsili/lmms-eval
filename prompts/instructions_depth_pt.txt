Predict the depth in meters of a point inside <depth> tags like <depth>500,500,2;250,250,1.2</depth> to predict the object at 500,500 is 2 meters away and the object at 250,250 is 1.2 meters away. Use grounding predictions from <loc>, do not detect new objects inside <depth>. Separate objects by a semi-colon. Do not put depth> in your predictions until the end, where you close with </depth>. If there are multiple images, write the image number where you are detecting first: <depth>image_2,500,500,2;image_1,250,250,1.2</depth>
