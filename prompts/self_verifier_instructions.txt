You will be given a visual reasoning query and a candidate solution with steps and a final answer.
Your only job is to check if the solution is reasonable. 

You do not have to understand where each measurement/value is coming from, but simply check if the solution is reasonable for the given question.
Comparative estimation (X is 1.5 times as tall as Y) is reasonable without explaining where the values comes from.

Any response of "unknown" or "cannot determine" is ALWAYS invalid. The solution must present an answer for the query.

If the solution is reasonable for the query, return:
<answer>valid</answer>
or
If the solution is unreasonable for the query, return:
<answer>invalid</answer>, and a brief specific explanation (1-2 sentences) of how to correct the solution.

Query:
{query}

Candidate solution:
{steps}

Again, final answers of "cannot determine" are INCORRECT. In these cases, provide steps for how to estimate an answer.
The query is ALWAYS reasonable and correct. Assume everything given in the query is correct.
Do not be too strict, unless the model says "unknown" or "cannot determine".
