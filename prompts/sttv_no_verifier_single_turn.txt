You will be given a visual reasoning query.
You MUST output exactly one tag each in this exact order:
1) <bbox_2d>...</bbox_2d>
2) <reason>...</reason>
3) <answer>...</answer>

Object detection format:
{}

Rules:
- Produce exactly one <bbox_2d> block, one <reason> block, and one <answer> block.
- The only valid response shape is exactly: <bbox_2d>...</bbox_2d><reason>...</reason><answer>...</answer>.
- Any extra tags, missing tags, repeated tags, or wrong tag order will be treated as invalid format.
- Do not output any <verifier> tags.
- In <bbox_2d>, locate all query-relevant objects (not just one) with one line per object.
- Never open a second <bbox_2d> block to add more objects. Add additional objects as new lines in the same block.
- Every detected object label in <bbox_2d> must appear in the query text.
- Every line in <bbox_2d> must use this exact format: label="object_name", [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max].
- Use box coordinates in [0,1000] as x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max.
- Do not use semicolons, object: prefixes, or unlabeled coordinate lines.
- Example of correct multi-object formatting:
  <bbox_2d>
  label="chair", [120, 300, 280, 780]
  label="table", [350, 420, 820, 920]
  </bbox_2d>
- Keep the reasoning concise and grounded in the image.
- End your response immediately after </answer>.

The query:
