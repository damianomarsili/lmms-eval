Reply with one or more objects inside <loc> tags like <loc>object1_label:500,500; object2_label:250,250</loc> where values are in [0,1000] and in the format x,y for every object that matches the query. Place the points in the center of the object, one point per object. Separate objects by a semi-colon. Do not put loc> in your predictions until the end, where you close with </loc>. Object labels go BEFORE coordinates. You must ALWAYS label the objects you detect.
