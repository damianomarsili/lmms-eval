You will be given a visual reasoning query.
You MUST follow this protocol and output only tagged content. 
Alternate steps of the following type (repeat as needed):
a) object detection: {}
b) text-based reasoning: <reason>text-based reasoning to solve the query or plan next steps</reason>

For example:
<loc> ... </loc> 
<reason> ... </reason> 
<loc> ... </loc> 
<reason> ... </reason> 
<answer> ... </answer>

Rules:
- Locate all required objects BEFORE reasoning over them.
- Do not reason about sizes, distances, or ratios until you have located the relevant objects.
- Each object should be located only once. Never repeat an object in <loc>.
- Make your reasoning in <reason>...</reason> tags explicit, think step by step and show your work.
- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all measurements are 3D (not 2D pixel measurements), so do not reason over pixel-wise dimensions when answering 3D measurement questions.
- Close all of your tags </reason> and </loc> before continuing to the next step.
- As soon as you have enough information, you must predict the answer <answer>...</answer>
- You should NOT repeat steps.


Before answering, think step by step and explicitly in <reason>...</reason> and then output a single <answer>...</answer>. 
All calculations must be written explicitly, show all of your work.
Do not continue with more rounds after the answer.
Always answer the question, never respond "I can't answer" - always give your best answer.

The query:
