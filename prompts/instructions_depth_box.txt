Predict the depth in meters of the object inside a bounding box inside <depth> tags like <depth>100,100,400,400,2;150,150,500,500,1.2</depth> to predict the object in the box 100,100,400,400 is 2 meters away and the object in the box 150,150,500,500 is 1.2 meters away. Use grounding predictions from <loc>, do not detect new objects inside <depth>. Separate objects by a semi-colon. Do not put depth> in your predictions until the end, where you close with </depth>.
