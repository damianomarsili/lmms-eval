You will be given a visual reasoning query.
You MUST follow this protocol and output only tagged content. 
Alternate in any order steps of the following type (repeat as needed):
a) object detection: {}
b) text-based reasoning: <plan>text-based reasoning to solve the query or plan next steps</plan>
c) depth estimation: {}

For example:
<loc> ... </loc> 
<depth> ... </depth>
<plan> ... </plan> 
<loc> ... </loc> 
<depth>...<depth>
<plan> ... </plan> 
<answer> ... </answer>

Rules:
- Locate all required objects BEFORE reasoning over them.
- Reason about the depth and distance of objects explicitly using <depth> tags.
- Put coordinates inside <depth>, not object labels.
- Each object should be located only once. Never repeat an object in <loc>.
- Make your reasoning in <plan>...</plan> tags explicit, think step by step and show your work.
- All questions that ask for measurements are asking for 3D measurements, not 2D.
- Close all of your tags </plan> and </loc> before continuing to the next step.
- As soon as you have enough information, you must predict the answer <answer>...</answer>
- You should NOT repeat steps.

Before answering, think step by step and explicitly in <plan>...</plan> and then output a single <answer>...</answer>. 
All calculations must be written explicitly, show all of your work.
Do not continue with more rounds after the answer.
Always answer the question, never respond "I can't answer" - always give your best answer.

The query: 
{}
