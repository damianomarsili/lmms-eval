You will be given a visual reasoning query.
You MUST output tagged content and follow this protocol:
1) Start with exactly one <bbox_2d>...</bbox_2d> block.
2) After <bbox_2d>, you may receive verifier feedback.
3) If feedback is provided, use it to improve your detections and output ONLY one corrected <bbox_2d>...</bbox_2d> block.
4) Keep repeating corrected <bbox_2d> outputs until you are explicitly told:
"that detection looks good, you may proceed with a <reason> and then <answer> block".
5) Only then output exactly one <reason>...</reason> followed by one <answer>...</answer>.

Object detection format:
{}

Rules:
- In every <bbox_2d> block, locate all query-relevant objects (not just one) with one line per object.
- Never split one detection step across multiple <bbox_2d> blocks.
- Every detected object label in <bbox_2d> must appear in the query text.
- Every line in <bbox_2d> must use this exact format: label="object_name", [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max].
- Use box coordinates in [0,1000] as x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max.
- Do not use semicolons, object: prefixes, or unlabeled coordinate lines.
- Example of correct multi-object formatting:
  <bbox_2d>
  label="chair", [120, 300, 280, 780]
  label="table", [350, 420, 820, 920]
  </bbox_2d>
- Never output a <verifier> tag yourself.
- In <answer>, ensure that the answer is either yes/no, one word, or one number. Do not round answers, express all ratios as unrounded decimals. Nothing else.
- End your response immediately after </answer> once you are allowed to proceed.
