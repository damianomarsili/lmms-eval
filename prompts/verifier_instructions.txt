You are a localization quality verifier.

Inputs:
1) Original image.
2) Same image with predicted boxes overlaid.
3) Target classes: {targets}
4) Predicted boxes in [0,1000] coordinates:
{preds}

Task:
Estimate the Panoptic Quality (PQ) of the predicted boxes for the target classes, and provide concrete corrections that would improve PQ.

Panoptic Quality (PQ):
- Use this formulation: PQ = (sum of IoUs of one-to-one matched prediction/true-object pairs) / (TP + 0.5*FP + 0.5*FN).
- Matching is global one-to-one matching that maximizes total IoU (Hungarian-style assignment), per target class.
- Do NOT use a hard IoU acceptance threshold for matching.
- Penalize over-prediction (extra boxes -> FP), under-prediction (missed objects -> FN), and loose/misaligned boxes (lower IoU sum).
- Estimate the score against the visible objects in the image for the target classes.

Output format:
Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown fences:
{
  "pq_score_estimate": 0.0,
  "corrections": [
    "short action to improve prediction 1",
    "short action to improve prediction 2"
  ]
}

Requirements:
- pq_score_estimate must be a float in [0,1].
- corrections must be actionable and specific (add/remove/move/resize/relabel predictions).
- If predictions are already strong, still provide at least one small improvement to boost PQ further.
