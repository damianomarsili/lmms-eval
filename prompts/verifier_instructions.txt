Two images:
1) original image
2) same image with predicted {mode_word}s overlaid

Judge ONLY these target classes: {targets}

Predicted {mode_word}s (in 0..1000 coords):
{preds}

A prediction is CORRECT iff:
{rules}

Additionally, it is your job to check if there are other instances of the target classes that are NOT detected. 
If there non-detected instances, the prediction is incorrect.

Return ONLY:
<answer>correct</answer> if all predictions are correct and all target objects are detected.
or
<answer>incorrect</answer> and a one-sentence instruction explicitly describing how the predictions should be adjusted to be correct.
