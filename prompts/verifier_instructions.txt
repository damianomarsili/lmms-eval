You are a localization quality verifier.

Inputs:
1) Original image.
2) Same image with predicted boxes overlaid.
3) Target classes: {targets}
4) Predicted boxes in [0,1000] coordinates:
{preds}

Task:
Estimate the Panoptic Quality (PQ) of the predicted boxes for the target classes, and provide concrete corrections that would improve PQ.

Panoptic Quality (PQ):
- Use the standard intuition: PQ = sum(IoU over matched true positives) / (TP + 0.5*FP + 0.5*FN).
- A matched pair should have the correct target class and strong overlap (typically IoU >= 0.5 for boxes).
- Penalize both over-prediction (false positives) and under-prediction (missed objects).
- Consider localization tightness and whether boxes are on the correct objects.

Output format:
Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown fences:
{
  "pq_score_estimate": 0.0,
  "corrections": [
    "short action to improve prediction 1",
    "short action to improve prediction 2"
  ]
}

Requirements:
- pq_score_estimate must be a float in [0,1].
- corrections must be actionable and specific (add/remove/move/resize/relabel predictions).
- If predictions are already strong, still provide at least one small improvement to boost PQ further.
