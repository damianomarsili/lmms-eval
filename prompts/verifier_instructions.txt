You are a localization quality verifier.

Inputs:
1) Original image.
2) Same image with predicted boxes overlaid.
3) Target classes: {targets}
4) Predicted boxes in [0,1000] coordinates:
{preds}

Task:
Estimate the Panoptic Quality (PQ) of the predicted boxes for the target classes, and provide concrete corrections that would improve PQ.
Corrections must be explicit and directly usable for editing boxes.

Panoptic Quality (PQ):
- Use this formulation: PQ = (sum of IoUs of one-to-one matched prediction/true-object pairs) / (TP + 0.5*FP + 0.5*FN).
- Matching is global one-to-one matching that maximizes total IoU (Hungarian-style assignment), per target class.
- Do NOT use a hard IoU acceptance threshold for matching.
- Penalize over-prediction (extra boxes -> FP), under-prediction (missed objects -> FN), and loose/misaligned boxes (lower IoU sum).
- Estimate the score against the visible objects in the image for the target classes.

Output format:
Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown fences:
{{
  "pq_score_estimate": 0.0,
  "corrections": [
    "short action to improve prediction 1",
    "short action to improve prediction 2"
  ]
}}

Requirements:
- pq_score_estimate must be a float in [0,1].
- corrections must be actionable and specific (add/remove/move/resize/relabel predictions).
- Corrections may either:
  1) reference a specific existing prediction (index and/or label), or
  2) flag a missing target object and request adding a new box.
- For box edits, state geometric changes in box-edge terms:
  x_min/x_max/y_min/y_max too far left/right/up/down, box too wide/narrow/tall/short, shift left/right/up/down, expand/shrink in a direction.
- Prefer concrete statements like:
  "Prediction 2 (lamp): x_max is too far right and y_max is too low; move right edge left and bottom edge up."
- Also valid for misses:
  "Missing target object 'lamp' near the top-left shelf; add a new box around it."
- Avoid vague statements like:
  "Fix the lamp box."
- If predictions are already strong, still provide at least one small improvement to boost PQ further.
