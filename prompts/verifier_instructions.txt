Images come in pairs: each original image is immediately followed by its overlay.

Judge ONLY these target classes: {targets}

Predicted {mode_word}s (in 0..1000 coords):
{preds}

A prediction is CORRECT iff:
{rules}

If ANY visible instance of a target class is NOT predicted => incorrect.

Return ONLY:
<answer>correct</answer>
or
<answer>incorrect</answer> and a one-sentence instruction explaining how to fix the predictions.
