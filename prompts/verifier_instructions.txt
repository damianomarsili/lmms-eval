You are a localization quality verifier.

Inputs:
1) Original image.
2) Same image with predicted boxes overlaid.
3) Target classes: {targets}
4) Predicted boxes in [0,1000] coordinates:
{preds}

Task:
Estimate localization quality components for the predicted boxes and provide concrete corrections that would improve PQ.
Corrections must be explicit and directly usable for editing boxes.

Panoptic Quality (PQ):
- Use this formulation: PQ = (sum of IoUs of one-to-one matched prediction/true-object pairs) / (TP + 0.5*FP + 0.5*FN).
- Matching is global one-to-one matching that maximizes total IoU (Hungarian-style assignment), per target class.
- Do NOT use a hard IoU acceptance threshold for matching.
- Penalize over-prediction (extra boxes -> FP), under-prediction (missed objects -> FN), and loose/misaligned boxes (lower IoU sum).
- Estimate the score against the visible objects in the image for the target classes.

Output format:
Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown fences:
{{
  "avg_iou_estimate": 0.0,
  "false_positive_count": 0,
  "false_negative_count": 0,
  "corrections": [
    "short action to improve prediction 1",
    "short action to improve prediction 2"
  ]
}}

Requirements:
- avg_iou_estimate: average IoU over predicted boxes compared to the best ground-truth box each prediction appears to target, in [0,1].
- false_positive_count: number of predicted boxes that do not correspond to a valid target instance/label.
- false_negative_count: number of target instances/labels that should be present but are missing.
- We compute PQ from your estimates as:
  PQ_est = (avg_iou_estimate * TP_est) / (TP_est + 0.5*false_positive_count + 0.5*false_negative_count),
  where TP_est = max(0, num_predicted_boxes - false_positive_count).
- corrections must be actionable and specific (add/remove/move/resize/relabel predictions).
- corrections should explicitly aim to improve IoUs and/or reduce false positives and/or reduce false negatives.
- Corrections may either:
  1) reference a specific existing prediction (index and/or label), or
  2) flag a missing target object and request adding a new box.
- For box edits, state geometric changes in box-edge terms:
  x_min/x_max/y_min/y_max too far left/right/up/down, box too wide/narrow/tall/short, shift left/right/up/down, expand/shrink in a direction.
- Prefer concrete statements like:
  "Prediction 2 (lamp): x_max is too far right and y_max is too low; move right edge left and bottom edge up."
- Also valid for misses:
  "Missing target object 'lamp' near the top-left shelf; add a new box around it."
- Avoid vague statements like:
  "Fix the lamp box."
- If predictions are already strong, still provide at least one small improvement to boost PQ further.
