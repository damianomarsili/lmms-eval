Reply with one or more <loc> tags like <loc>object1_label:100,100,400,400; object2_label:150,150,500,500</loc> where values are in [0,1000] and in the format x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max for every object that matches the query. Separate objects by a semi-colon. Do not put loc> in your predictions until the end, where you close with </loc>. If there are multiple images, write the image number where you are detecting first: <loc>image_1,object1_label:100,100,400,400; image_2,object2_label:150,150,500,500</loc>
