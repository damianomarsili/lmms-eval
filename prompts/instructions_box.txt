Reply with exactly one <bbox_2d> block. Inside <bbox_2d>, write one object per line in this exact format:
label="object_name", [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]

Rules:
- Coordinates must be in [0,1000].
- Use x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max.
- Include every relevant object.
- Do not split objects across multiple <bbox_2d> blocks.
- Each detected object label must appear in the query text.
- Do not use semicolons or object: prefixes.
- Do not output anything outside <bbox_2d> ... </bbox_2d> for this step.
