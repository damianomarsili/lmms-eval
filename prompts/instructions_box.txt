Reply with exactly one <bbox_2d> block. Inside <bbox_2d>, write one object per line in this exact format:
1: label="object_name", [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]

Example (multiple objects in ONE <bbox_2d> block):
<bbox_2d>
1: label="chair", [120, 300, 280, 780]
2: label="table", [350, 420, 820, 920]
3: label="lamp", [840, 120, 960, 420]
</bbox_2d>

Rules:
- Coordinates must be in [0,1000].
- Use x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max.
- Locate all query-relevant objects and include every relevant object.
- Do not split objects across multiple <bbox_2d> blocks.
- Indices must be sequential starting from 1, one index per line.
- Each detected object label must appear in the query text.
- Do not use semicolons or object: prefixes.
- Do not output anything outside <bbox_2d> ... </bbox_2d> for this step.
